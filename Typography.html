    <p>Cats are lovely pets that many people keep at home. They are small and have soft fur that feels nice when you
        touch it.
        Cats have sharp claws and teeth, which they use to catch mice. They like to play with balls, strings, or even a
        light
        spot. Cats make a sound called ‘meow’ to talk to us. They like to drink milk and eat fish.</p>
